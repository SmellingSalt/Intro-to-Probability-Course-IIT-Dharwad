# Week 1
## Question 1
Explain PMF/PDF

## Answer 1
Say there is a uniform RV in $[a,b]$\
The PDF is plotted by considering very small intervals within the range
The probability of any number within these tiny ranges can be plotted.\
This way we create the PDF.\
Probobility defined for discrete sample space is called PMF\
Example: Let $X$ be the random variable which take values from 1 to 10. The probability that randomly selected number is 3 will be
$$P(X=3)=1/10.$$
Probability defined for continuous sample space is PDF\
*Example:* Let $Y$ be the random variable which takes values from a number between $1$ to $10$\
P(Y=3)=0
But P(3.1<Y<3.2)=0.1/10
